File 1:

meshdesc_wiki.json contains the main dataset used in this work. It aligns a MeSH descriptor ID into a Wikipedia page (extracted from Wikidata). To convert Mesh Descriptor IDs to UMLS CUI, either use mesh_cui.json file or process MRCONSO.RFF (https://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/2020AB/umls-2020AB-mrconso.zip) where different vocabularies (including Mesh Descriptor IDs are mapped to UMLS CUIs).


File 2: 
cui_wiki.json contains a broader set of alignments between UMLS and Wikidata. This data is not used in our work.

File 3:
mesh_cui.json contains mapping between a MeSH descriptor ids and UMLS CUIs.
